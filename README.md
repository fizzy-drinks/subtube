# SubTube

In 2021, YouTube removed community subtitles due to abuse reports. This has
left many YouTubers who relied on viewer subtitles in the dark. SubTube is a
YouTube player with SRT support and a built-in subtitle editor, mainly directed
at, but not limited to, educational content.

This project was initially made as a React prototype and quickly forgotten
about. The original prototype is archived but can be
[seen on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/fizzydrinks/subtube). The updated version
is currently a work in progress.
